Antivirus Tutorial Project

This repository contains my implementation of the antivirus project from the YouTube tutorial.
I'm using this project to gain hands-on experience with Python scripting and understand the inner workings of antivirus software.

Project Overview
In this project, I'm building different components of an antivirus, including:
signature-based detection, file and directroy scanning, and later behavioral analysis, etc.

I may use this same repo as I learn with other tutorials.  I hope to learn more about heuristic detection.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
Learn about the fundamentals of antivirus software
Practice Python scripting and development
Gain experience with cybersecurity concepts and techniques

Tutorial Link
You can find the original tutorial on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2tIh4rwovY

The purpose of this repository is for personal learning and development. If you'd like to suggest improvements or provide feedback, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
